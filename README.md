#### Abstract
Building Data Science Capacity within the BC Public Service: A Decade of Progress

Stephanie Hazlitt, PhD

Building data science capacity is important for governments to leverage the vast amounts of data available, improve decision-making, enhance public services, and address complex challenges. The BC Public Service has seen a significant shift towards the use of R and other data science tools for data analysis and communication. This talk will share insider observations of some of the events, infrastructure, and culture changes that have helped kickstart and support progress towards the use and growth of R and data science tools across teams in the BC Public Service. Together these changes, with ongoing organizational support, have enabled individuals, teams, and leadership in the BC Public Service to shift towards more programmatic, open and reproducible data science workflows.
